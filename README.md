## Python Camera Classifier

This is a desktop application that uses a live camera feed to train and classify images into two user-defined categories.
The app leverages Support Vector Machines (SVM) from scikit-learn and provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.
It allows users to collect image data, train a model, and predict live camera feed inputs in real time.
